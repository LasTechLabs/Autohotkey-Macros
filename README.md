# Autohotkey-Macros

***Current Mappings***:

- `ctrl` + `shift` + `q` => open snipping tool and/or start new snip

- `LaunchMedia` => `home`
	- `shift` + `LaunchMedia` also works as expected

- `capslock` + `q` + `u` => `left click`

- `capslock` + `q` + `o` => `right click`

- `capslock` + `q` + [`i`, `k`, `j`, `l`] => `MoveMouse` [up, down, left, right]
	- mouse movement speed controlled by Mouse_Offset variable

- `capslock` + `\` => `home`
	- `shift` + `capslock` + `\` also works as expected

- `capslock` + `RShift` => `end`
	- `Shift` + `capslock` + `RShift` also works as expected

- `capslock` + [`i`, `k`, `j`, `l`] => `arrow key` [up, down, left, right]
	- [`LShift`, `Ctrl`, `Alt`, `WindowsKey`] + `capslock` + [`i`, `k`, `j`, `l`] also work (mostly) as expected
	- note `capslock` + `l` + `WindowsKey` does not work as expected. It puts computer to sleep
		
- `WindowsKey` + `l` => put computer to sleep
